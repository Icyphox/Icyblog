      <description>Henlo.
It&amp;rsquo;s actually been super long since I&amp;rsquo;ve written. Had a lot of IRL stuff going on. And I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on some projects of my own too, like Vite. It&amp;rsquo;s a super comfy static site generator written in Python. Write your posts in Markdown, make a simple template of sorts, and render it.
Also, if you&amp;rsquo;ve hung around here before, you should probably know that I use (neo)Vim for all my text editing (apart from the occasional VSCode for Angular).</description>

      <description>Topkek, here&amp;rsquo;s another. See the thing is, I do so many things between two consecutive posts, I&amp;rsquo;m forced to end up writing something that encompasses all of that. I should perhaps add a blitz blog section. I&amp;rsquo;ll put stuff up there as and when I do them - a journal of sorts. Anywway, here&amp;rsquo;s my third installment of the Slice Of Life series.
Ohhh wait, did you see the new domain?</description>

      <description>HeyGuys
Heh, posting frequency&amp;rsquo;s gone to shit, but meh. I write for myself. I mean, I&amp;rsquo;m genuinly surprised when some random Peruvian stumbles upon my blog and looks at it for a minute and thirty. Google Analytics, yeah.
Anyway, a few new things. If you follow my Github, or happen to glance at it every once in a while, this site&amp;rsquo;s now on Github Pages! \o/
Not really \o/, since I don&amp;rsquo;t have that server that fs0ciety&amp;rsquo;d given me, but tbf, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t using it for anything else besides this website.</description>

      <description>It has been reaaallyy long since I&amp;rsquo;ve written, gosh, what was it? 3 months? w e w l a d. Most&amp;rsquo;ve my time is taken up by University coursework. Yes, I am no more a school (pfft) student.
Unfortunately though, I have hardly been upto anything &amp;lsquo;technical&amp;rsquo;, which explains why I&amp;rsquo;m resorting to writing lame posts about, well, life. This can mostly be blamed on my crappy campus WiFi which has a ruddy port whitelist allowing traffic only through 80 and 443, monitored by a HTTP/HTTPS proxy.</description>

      <title>Getting into the core: Atmospheric metalcore</title>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t touched the metalcore topic in quite a while, so I decided I&amp;rsquo;d write about one of my most faviourite sub-subgenres &amp;ndash; atmospheric metalcore.
What makes an atmospheric metalcore band? Considering that metalcore is a pretty niche subgenre of metal, atmospheric metalcore is the nichest of the niche. So there isn&amp;rsquo;t any specifics as to what defines atmospheric metalcore. But most atmospheric metalcore bands share a few common features.</description>

      <title>A broken Arch system (All credits to OpenSSL)</title>

      <description>Just yesterday, I decided to update OpenSSL because, why not? It was at version 1.0.0, which was quite outdated (2016). Anyway, I ran the update using pacman -S openssl.
It finished without any issues, but guess what, it broke sudo and pacman. The two things, without which using your box would be&amp;hellip; dumb?
So sudo threw an error about a missing shared library called libssl.so.1.0.0 and pacman cried about libcrypto.</description>

      <description>I normally make it a point to post within about a week of my previous post, but this time, a lot of stuff happened, and that kept me busy.
Of my VPS If you recall, either on Twitter or Facebook, I&amp;rsquo;d posted about having moved to a VPS of my own, which I got for free from FuslVZ. Well, that got taken down, due to a few ahem problems with the people who run the service.</description>

      <description>I usually frequent this website/blog called n0where.net. They&amp;rsquo;ve got some really unique tools and utilities that pertain to pentesting or forensics. So that&amp;rsquo;s where I found PRET.
The PRinter Exploitation Toolkit This tool was developed mainly to ease the whole process of attacking a printer. Seriously, who woulda thunk you could even hack a printer?
Anyway, before we delve in, here&amp;rsquo;s a bit of background on the whole subject. Essentially, prnters are configured and interacted with, by using a printer language.</description>

      <description>So my exams just ended, and I&amp;rsquo;m free for a really long time. There&amp;rsquo;s so much that I did during those holidays in-between tests (ssshh, don&amp;rsquo;t tell anyone), but I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t write about it. So here it is, all in one post.
My VPS If you remember, I&amp;rsquo;d written something about fs0ciety letting me use his VPS, or at least offering it. Anyway, he didn&amp;rsquo;t have to, because just about a week ago, I managed to procure my own from FuslVZ.</description>

      <description>Going AFK So with the Grade 12 final exams coming up, I&amp;rsquo;m going AFK. Not my decision, but my Mom&amp;rsquo;s. She&amp;rsquo;s doing all kinds of stuff to get me off my PC, she even went to the extent of locking up my keyboard :D (Of course, I had a backup keyboard kept hidden in case of such a situation, but she doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to know that :P).
She even made me kill my SSH server because I was SSHing into my desky from my phone.</description>

      <title>Firesale: Is it really possible?</title>

      <guid>https://icyphox.github.io/blog/firesale/</guid>
      <description>What is a Firesale? A Firesale is a theoretical cyber attack where all the vital networks like gas, water, transportation, finance, etc. are taken down, thus crippling the nation under the attack.
The word itself loosely means &amp;quot;everything must go&amp;quot;. In the word Firesale, F stands for financial, I for infrastructure, R for Resources and E for Environment.
In reality, the word Firesale isn&amp;rsquo;t a cyber-security term at all. It was invented in the movie Die Hard 4.</description>

      <description>This post took waayy longer than it should&amp;rsquo;ve, but I was stuck up doing quite a bit of l33t and h4xy things (things l33ter and h4xi3r than this blog, yes). This post isn&amp;rsquo;t specific to just one topic, and since I&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot of things to write about. So&amp;hellip;, without further ado, let&amp;rsquo;s get started.
Sailfish OS About 3 days back, @drakonizer reminded me about Sailfish OS (yeah, I knew it existed, just didn&amp;rsquo;t care), and I decided to give it a whirl on my Nexus 5.</description>

      <description>It took a good week and a little bit more for this post. I was busy ricing my box again (here), and preparing for my switch to 2bwm. You see, I realized that I&amp;rsquo;ve been floating my windows an unhealthy amount, in a tiling window manager - i3.
Anyway, IRC (Internet Relay Chat). It&amp;rsquo;s been around for years, and you can chat in real-time with people from all around the world, in channels.</description>

      <title>Theory of Bluetooth Hacking</title>

      <guid>https://icyphox.github.io/blog/bthacking/</guid>
      <description>I recently got myself a pair of these sweg Bose Bluetooth headsets, and an idea occured to me. If you could hijack someone&amp;rsquo;s bluetooth speaker/headset, and play your own music, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t that be sweet? So I did some research on BT&amp;rsquo;s protocols, possible exploits, etc., and came up with this theory (and it turns out that it is quite possible).
Bluetooth is a pretty basic stack, in communication protocols. But it is quite secure.</description>

      <title>Man In Ze Middle Attacks (MIZM)</title>

      <guid>https://icyphox.github.io/blog/mitm/</guid>
      <description>First off, it&amp;rsquo;s MITM. I wrote the Ze because I&amp;rsquo;m pretentious. An MITM attack is fairly straightforward, it&amp;rsquo;s what the name says. There&amp;rsquo;s a transaction happening between two computers, and it gets intercepted by a 3rd party - the man in the middle.
So this attack has various applications, in cryptography and in computer security.
In cryptography So there&amp;rsquo;s this very common example given using the characters Alice, Bob, and Mallory.</description>

      <guid>https://icyphox.github.io/blog/synthwave/</guid>
      <description>Synthwave, also called New Retro Wave or just Retrowave, is an epic genre I just got into. It mainly appeals to me because of it&amp;rsquo;s cyberpunk-ish feel. The whole theme of this genre is that retro futuristic feel, y&amp;rsquo;know, that whole idea of a very dark city, with huge tall towers, with flying-cars&amp;hellip; Essentially a Tron-like thing.
There are 2 primary styles in synthwave, one&amp;rsquo;s a very dark perspective, kinda like Terminator, and one&amp;rsquo;s a very positive/relaxing style.</description>

In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to be walking you through the process of creating a Python backdoor (for Windows), but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really use Python itself. How? Well of course, we shall be using the Windows port of the pretty (in)famous netcat.
A little introduction on netcat or nc So ncis actually a GNU/Linux utility, that was created primarily to connect to and write/read using TCP or UDP.</description>

      <description>This is going to be an interesting topic to talk about. Why did I pick this? Primarily because I love this genre of music, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t deserve the hate it gets, even from some of the so called elitist metalhead communities. So how did this all start? It all began in the early 2000s, with the scene kids.
Scene Kids In the early 2000s there existed a special kind of rebellious teenagers, termed as &amp;ldquo;scene kids&amp;rdquo;.</description>

But yes! Bedrock Linux is really really cool. It&amp;rsquo;s all the good stuff from the major distros, all in one.

The types of information that a social engineer seeks may vary, it could be to get you to give them a password, allow them to access your workstation remotely (sometimes create an account forfor them on your PC!</description>

      <description>On Github, doing a simple search for the keyphrase text editor, you see nearly 7000 repositories alone, with that keyphrase. And then there are 41.5 million results under the Code section. What does this search tell us? Text editors are batsh*t crazy all over the Internet. People basically write text editors as their first coding program.
So I&amp;rsquo;ve come up with a pretty straightforward comparison of text editors for various kinds of users, be it a 1337 h4x0r or a Bio student, there&amp;rsquo;s one for you.</description>

      <description>What is licensing anyway? There is a lot a confusion with regard to what licensing means. In essence, when you license your work, you don&amp;rsquo;t lose or give away any of your rights to that software.
You still hold the original copyright on that work. What a license does is grants certain permissions for others to contribute/use that work.
It&amp;rsquo;s much better than just releasing your work into the public domain (like this), or giving permissions on a case-by-case basis.</description>

What&amp;rsquo;s ricing now? Is there a wheating too? I agree, that&amp;rsquo;s a super lame subheading, but whatever. So, ricing.
It can be defined as the hipster version of customizing. Yeah, we all *nixers got sweg, yo. Doing anything to make your desktop look pretty. You can edit colorschemes in .Xresources, you can use conky and add a fancy looking system status HUD, you can use cava and have a music visualizer, right in your terminal, the possibilities are endless.</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned metalcore a couple of times, what is it? Metalcore is a genre of extreme music, which blends hardcore punk and metal. This turns to sound much heavier than normal metal. Metalcore has a few interesting characteristics that sets it apart from mainstream metal.
First off, breakdowns. This is a huge difference between the two, mainly because it adds a bit more heaviness to the music. Breakdowns can, in some ways be compared to bass drops.</description>

You&amp;rsquo;re probably wondering what kind of challenge I&amp;rsquo;d have gone through in making this blog. Well, believe it or not, this entire blog, including this post, was created in just one terminal instance.
If you&amp;rsquo;re one of the people who knows what a terminal is (believe me, I know people who don&amp;rsquo;t), then you&amp;rsquo;d be sceptical.</description>
