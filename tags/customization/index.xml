      <description>HeyGuys
Heh, posting frequency&amp;rsquo;s gone to shit, but meh. I write for myself. I mean, I&amp;rsquo;m genuinly surprised when some random Peruvian stumbles upon my blog and looks at it for a minute and thirty. Google Analytics, yeah.
Anyway, a few new things. If you follow my Github, or happen to glance at it every once in a while, this site&amp;rsquo;s now on Github Pages! \o/
Not really \o/, since I don&amp;rsquo;t have that server that fs0ciety&amp;rsquo;d given me, but tbf, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t using it for anything else besides this website.</description>

      <description>So this is my first post to do with Linux. And I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about ricing.
What&amp;rsquo;s ricing now? Is there a wheating too? I agree, that&amp;rsquo;s a super lame subheading, but whatever. So, ricing.
It can be defined as the hipster version of customizing. Yeah, we all *nixers got sweg, yo. Doing anything to make your desktop look pretty. You can edit colorschemes in .Xresources, you can use conky and add a fancy looking system status HUD, you can use cava and have a music visualizer, right in your terminal, the possibilities are endless.</description>
